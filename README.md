# teleport-kit

The current web-development world pride itself of blurring the line between backend and frontend and this is mostly done throw a process known as hydration. Your components are executed on the server and the html document is sent with all the information already in it. Later on components are re-executed on the client and listeners are attached to the elements to allow for a reactive environment without the need of a full page reload.

This is generally not a problem but it can become a problem if the functions invoked are non deterministic. An example of this could be `Math.random()` or `crypto.randomUUID` or even simpler `new Date()`. Between the two executions (the server and the client) those two values could (and most likely will) change creating in the best case a random flicker in the UI, in the worst an hydration mismatch (even tho Svelte is pretty good at dealing with those ðŸ˜Ž)

`teleport-kit` aim to solve this issue allowing you to specify variables that will be initialized with a value on the server and will have the same value once hydrated on the client!

## Installation

Install teleport-kit with npm

```bash
  npm install teleport-kit@latest
```

## Setup

After the installation of `teleport-kit` you need to do an extra step to allow the library to work for you: create or update your `hooks.server.ts` file.

```ts
export { handle } from 'teleport-kit';
```

if you already have another server handle already in your project you can make use of the `sequence` helper from Sveltekit ([link to docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-hooks-sequence))

```ts
import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';
import { handle as teleportkit } from 'teleport-kit';

export const handle = sequence(teleportkit, ({ event, resolve }) => {
	// your logic here
	return resolve(event);
});
```

## Usage/Examples

Once you've done with this setup you can start using the `teleport` function inside your svelte components

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { teleport } from 'teleport-kit';

	let random = teleport('random', () => Math.random());
</script>

My random value: {random}
```

as you can see there's another small catch to use this library: you need to provide a unique name for your teleported variable in the form of the first argument of the `teleport` function. Is important that this name is:

- the same on the server and on the client
- unique for your whole route (this means every teleported variable including the ones in child layouts and components)

It's also important that the value you return is serializable by [`devalue`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue) (it's the same serialization library Svelte-kit uses...if you can return it from a server load function you can teleport it with `teleport-kit`!)

## How it works?

I know you are curious!

1. The handle function that you exports from `hooks.server.ts` wrap your whole Svelte-kit application in an `AsyncLocalStorage` so that every request will have it's own context.
2. Through the use of esm exports the `teleport` function that you execute on the server will update the storage assigning a property based on the name you provide with the value returned from your function and will return the value itself.
3. After the request is resolved in the server hook the html is transformed to append a small `<script>` tag containing the teleported values.
4. On the client the `teleport` function (different from the one on the server thanks to esm exports) will read the content of the aforementioned script tag and return the value present there instead of calling the function. If no value is found the function is called and the value returned.
5. the already served value is deleted from the script tag to avoid serving the same value if the component is unmounted and remounted.

And that's it!
